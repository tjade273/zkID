/**
 * The code below provides an example of all stages of running a R1CS GG-ppzkSNARK.
 *
 * Of course, in a real-life scenario, we would have three distinct entities,
 * mangled into one in the demonstration below. The three entities are as follows.
 * (1) The "generator", which runs the ppzkSNARK generator on input a given
 *     constraint system CS to create a proving and a verification key for CS.
 * (2) The "prover", which runs the ppzkSNARK prover on input the proving key,
 *     a primary input for CS, and an auxiliary input for CS.
 * (3) The "verifier", which runs the ppzkSNARK verifier on input the verification key,
 *     a primary input for CS, and a proof.
