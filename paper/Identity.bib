  abstract = {Anonymous credentials provide a powerful tool for making assertions about identity while maintaining privacy. However, a limitation of today's anonymous credential systems is the need for a trusted credential issuer --- which is both a single point of failure and a target for compromise. Furthermore, the need for such a trusted issuer can make it challenging to deploy credential systems in practice, particularly in the ad hoc network setting (e.g., anonymous peer-to-peer networks) where no single party can be trusted with this responsibility.

In this work we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a trusted credential issuer. Our approach builds on recent results in the area of electronic cash and uses techniques --- such as the calculation of a distributed transaction ledger --- that are currently in widespread deployment in the Bitcoin payment system. Using this decentralized ledger and standard cryptographic primitives, we propose and provide a proof of security for a basic anonymous credential system that allows users to make flexible identity assertions with strong privacy guarantees. Finally, we discuss a number of practical applications for our techniques, including resource management in ad hoc networks and prevention of Sybil attacks. We implement our scheme and measure its efficiency.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the direct anonymous attestation scheme (DAA). This scheme was adopted by the Trusted Computing Group as the method for remote authentication of a hardware module, called trusted platform module (TPM), while preserving the privacy of the user of the platform that contains the module. Direct anonymous attestation can be seen as a group signature without the feature that a signature can be opened, i.e., the anonymity is not revocable. Moreover, DAA allows for pseudonyms, i.e., for each signature a user (in agreement with the recipient of the signature) can decide whether or not the signature should be linkable to another signature. DAA furthermore allows for detection of ``known'' keys: if the DAA secret keys are extracted from a TPM and published, a verifier can detect that a signature was produced using these secret keys. The scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under the strong RSA and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption.},

  abstract = {Bitcoin is the first e-cash system to see widespread adoption. While Bitcoin offers the potential for new types of financial interaction, it has significant limitations regarding privacy. Specifically, because the Bitcoin transaction log is completely public, users' privacy is protected only through the use of pseudonyms. In this paper we propose Zerocoin, a cryptographic extension to Bitcoin that augments the protocol to allow for fully anonymous currency transactions. Our system uses standard cryptographic assumptions and does not introduce new trusted parties or otherwise change the security model of Bitcoin. We detail Zerocoin's cryptographic construction, its integration into Bitcoin, and examine its performance both in terms of computation and impact on the Bitcoin protocol.},

  url = {http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/495},
  abstract = {We put forward the study of a new primitive that we call \{$\backslash$em Vector Commitment\} (VC, for short). Informally, VCs allow to commit to an ordered sequence of \$q\$ values \$(m\_1, $\backslash$ldots, m\_q)\$ in such a way that one can later open the commitment at specific positions (e.g., prove that \$m\_i\$ is the \$i\$-th committed message). For security, Vector Commitments are required to satisfy a notion that we call $\backslash$emph\{position binding\} which states that an adversary should not be able to open a commitment to two different values at the same position. Moreover, what makes our primitive interesting is that we require VCs to be \{$\backslash$em concise\}, i.e. the size of the commitment string and of its openings has to be independent of the vector length.

We show two realizations of VCs based on standard and well established assumptions, such as RSA, and Computational Diffie-Hellman (in bilinear groups). Next, we turn our attention to applications and we show that Vector Commitments are useful in a variety of contexts, as they allow for compact and efficient solutions which significantly improve previous works either in terms of efficiency of the resulting solutions, or in terms of "quality" of the underlying assumption, or both. These applications include: Verifiable Databases with Efficient Updates, Updatable Zero-Knowledge Databases, and Universal Dynamic Accumulators.},

An accumulator scheme allows one to hash a large set of inputs into one short value, such that there is a short proof that a given input was incorporated into this value. A dynamic accumulator allows one to dynamically add and delete a value, such that the cost of an add or delete is independent of the number of accumulated values. We provide a construction of a dynamic accumulator and an efficient zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of an accumulated value. We prove their security under the strong RSA assumption. We then show that our construction of dynamic accumulators enables efficient revocation of anonymous credentials, and membership revocation for recent group signature and identity escrow schemes.},

  abstract = {We create a credential system that lets a user anonymously authenticate at most \$n\$ times in a single time period. A user withdraws a dispenser of \$n\$ e-tokens. She shows an e-token to a verifier to authenticate herself; each e-token can be used only once, however, the dispenser automatically refreshes every time period. The only prior solution to this problem, due to DamgÃ¥rd et al.\textasciitilde[DDP05], uses protocols that are a factor of \$k\$ slower for the user and verifier, where \$k\$ is the security parameter. DamgÃ¥rd et al. also only support one authentication per time period, while we support \$n\$. Because our construction is based on e-cash, we can use existing techniques to identify a cheating user, trace all of her e-tokens, and revoke her dispensers. We also offer a new anonymity service: glitch protection for basically honest users who (occasionally) reuse e-tokens. The verifier can always recognize a reused e-token; however, we preserve the anonymity of users who do not reuse e-tokens too often.},
